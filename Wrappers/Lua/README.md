# Lua 5.4 wrapper for ATRC

Lua wrapper for ATRC. If your Lua is 64-bit, use 64-bit binaries, if your Lua is 32-bit, use 32-bit binaries
Prebuilt binaries can be downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/Antonako1/ATRC/releases).

ATRCLua.dll is compiled with VS 17 2022.
ATRCLua.so is compiled with GCC

Prebuilt package contents include:
    - Example application
    - Libs containing the ATRCLua library
    - Docs â€” ATRC documentation and Lua API documentation
    - License
    - CHANGELOG
    - VERSION
    - BUILDNUMBER
    - This README

**There are no prebuilt 32-bit binaries!**

## Usage and example(s)

To use ATRC in Lua:

 - Download ATRCLua from [Releases](https://github.com/Antonako1/ATRC/releases)
 - Extract it into your project folder
 - Change directory into your extracted ATRCLua directory
 - Windows:
    - Set libs/ATRC into your "PATH" environmental variable
    - Set libs/ATRCLua into your "LUA_CPATH" environmental variable
```cmd
SET "LUA_CPATH=%CD%\libs\ATRCLua\ATRCLua.dll;%LUA_CPATH%"
SET "PATH=%CD%\libs\ATRC\ATRC.dll;%PATH%"
```
 - Linux
    - Set libs/ATRC into your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environmental variable
    - Set libs/ATRCLua into your LUA_CPATH environmental variable
```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$(pwd)/libs/ATRC/libATRC.so:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
export LUA_CPATH="$(pwd)/libs/ATRCLua/ATRCLua.so;$LUA_CPATH"
```

```lua
local m = require("ATRCLua")

local fd = m.OpenATRC("file.atrc")
local res = ReadKey(fd, "Block", "Key")
print(res)
m.CloseATRC(fd)
```

## Building and testing

### Building the Lua bindings

Create a "libs" directory.

[Download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/luabinaries/files/5.4.2/) Lua binaries and extract them into "libs". Rename the Lua binary directory into "Lua".

Download latest release of [ATRC](https://github.com/Antonako1/ATRC/releases/) and extract it into "libs". Rename the ATRC directory into "ATRC".

Please check that Lua libraries, CMake and C/C++ compiler can be found in your path


After this run
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

---

### Testing the bindings

1. Inside the test directory, create a libs folder:
```bash
mkdir test/libs
```

2. Copy the compiled ATRCLua.so from the build folder into test/libs.

3. Also copy the libATRC.so from libs/ATRC/Linux/x64/Release into test/libs.

4. Set environment variables and run the test:

- On Linux:

```bash
export LUA_CPATH="$(pwd)/libs/?.so;;"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$(pwd)/libs:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
cd test
lua test.lua
```
- On Windows (Command Prompt):

```bash
SET "LUA_CPATH=%CD%\libs\?.dll;%LUA_CPATH%"
SET "PATH=%CD%\libs;%PATH%"
cd test
lua54 test.lua
```
